# To-Do List App

Welcome to the **To-Do List App**! This is a simple application built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** for managing tasks. You can perform operations like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.

This project is a RESTful API that allows you to manage a list of tasks. It's a perfect starting point for learning how to build APIs with Express and manage data with basic in-memory storage.

## Features

- **Add a new task** to the list.
- **View all tasks** in the list.
- **Get a task by ID**.
- **Update an existing task**.
- **Delete a task** by its ID.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js** - Fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js.
- **In-memory storage** for tasks (tasks are stored in an array for simplicity).
